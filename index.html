    <h2>About Me: &#x1F60E; </h2> 
    <p> I am a young man aged 23 years old. I graduated in 2019 from the <em>Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology</em> (JKUAT) with a degree in Quantity Surveying. I have three beautiful sisters and a loving mother. </p>
    <p> Since graduation, I have been on internship at Three N International, a contractors company. With the outbreak of the Covid 19 pandemic and its effects, I went on an unpaid leave. This situation accords me a fantastic opportunity to pursue a course in programming in this prestigious institution. </p>        
    <p> I decided to pursue programming at Moringa School largely because of inspiration from my mentor. He opened my eyes to see that I can utilise this time at home to add value to myself. Also, I've always admired coders and programmers. Their work is amazing. Who knows? Maybe I was also made for this :) So far, im totally enjoying learning new things which is fun and challenging at the same time and interacting with other awesome students.</p>
